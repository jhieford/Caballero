<h1>Why do I choose BSIT?</h1>
<body>
    <p>
    I choose BSIT(Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) because I want to become a game developer. I have always been interest in playing games and learning how they are made. I believe BSIT can give me the skills I need to create games that people will enjoy.
    <br>
    I also want to work with other people who share the same passion for technology. I know it will be challenging, but I am ready to work hard for my dream career. I also  want to meet classmates who have the same passion. I hope to create games that inspire and entertain people. <br>Working in I.T. gives me a sense of achievement when I solve problems or complete a project.

I.T. fits me because it challenges me and helps me stay sharp, while also offering exciting career paths.
